# Staci

drop-in, reactive signals ðŸ¤Œ

## Use-Case

`staci` is all about _compliementing_ existing HTML. Other solutions dictate the
way you write your HTML. When you want to generate HTML, you must do so **with
the framework**.

`staci` is different. She is not about replacing you're existing wife__ I mean
system. Rather, `staci` intends to join-in where needed and can be adopted
incrementally overtime.

## Philosophy

Imagine if signals were available natively in the DOM. That is the vibe `staci`
attempts to create.

Using signals should feel _natural_.
