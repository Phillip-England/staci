    staci.event("increment-count", () => {
        let count = staci.getSignal("count");
        count.set(count.val() + 1);

## Use-Case
`staci` is all about *compliementing* existing HTML. Other solutions dictate the way you write your HTML. When you want to generate HTML, you must do so **with the framework**.

`staci` is different. She is not about replacing you're existing wife__ I mean system. Rather, `staci` intends to join-in where needed and can be adopted incrementally overtime.
