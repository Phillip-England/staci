# Staci
A Suite of Web Components Which Add Behavior to Static HTML ðŸ’„

Staci is all about *complimenting* existing HTML. Simply drop in a few web components, add some attributes, and let Staci do all the work ðŸ¤¤.

Staci is not about replacing you're existing wife__ I mean system. Rather, Staci intends to join-in where needed. She can be adopted incrementally overtime.

## Counter Example
Need to define some `state`? Cool:
```html
<st-signal name="count" value="0" target="#current-count.text;"></st-state>
<st-event trigger="click" target="#increment-button">
    <script>
        staci.setState("count", staci.getState("count") + 1)
    </script>
</st-event>

<p id="current-count"></p>
<button id="increment-button">Increment</button>
```
