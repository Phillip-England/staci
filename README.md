    staci.createEvent("increment-count", () => {
        let [count, setCount] = staci.get("count");
        setCount(count + 1);

## Use-Case
`staci` is all about *compliementing* existing HTML. Other solutions dictate the way you write your HTML. When you want to generate HTML, you must do so **with the framework**.

`staci` is different. She is not about replacing you're existing wife__ I mean system. Rather, `staci` intends to join-in where needed and can be adopted incrementally overtime.
